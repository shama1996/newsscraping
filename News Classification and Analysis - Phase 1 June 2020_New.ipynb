While Manvitha and Ashika had a message that appeared to be of Turkish origin on the landing page, the hacker in Vasishta’s case was closer home, Mulbagal in Karnataka, and had been pretending to be the actor to chat with ‘fans’.\\nTHE ROAD TO RECOVERY\\n\\nThe actors sought expert help to retrieve their accounts and changed passwords and other personal log in details. In Ashika’s case, it was even quicker, as she had a two-factor authentication process lined up, which alerted her about some unusual activity.\\n\\nUPPING SECURITY FEATURES All three have since upped the security settings on their social media accounts with two-factor authentication to prevent future hacking possibilities.\\n\\nMEANWHILE, CYBER CRIME ON THE RISE, SAYS TOP COP\\n\\nBengaluru city commissioner of police Bhaskar Rao tells us, “There has been a spike in the rate of cybercrimes since the lockdown. Everyone is indoors, so the scope for physical crime isn’t as much. Instead, there are criminals lurking online. Just as you have locks for the doors and windows to prevent thefts at home, your internet activity needs to be completely secure to allow no one to enter.”\\n\\n\\nHacking of celeb accounts on the rise\\n\\nActor Dhruva Sarja’s wife Prerana’s Instagram handle has been renamed Instagramcentrecopyight for over a fortnight now. Even actress Pooja Hegde had claimed that her account was hacked, after ‘she’ made an unsavoury comment about a fellow artiste.\\n\\n\\nEXPERTSPEAK\\nDo no put your personal information in sources and sites that are likely to be compromised.\\nDon’t get lured by contests and give out your information. Be careful about what you share.\\nDo not access free Wi-fi unless you are sure of it. Choose to connect through a VPN if you use public Wi-fi for work.\\nTry to keep your confidential data encrypted on your devices. Whenever you sell an old laptop or mobile phone, format it and clear all data.\\nUse strong passwords and enable 2-factor authentication whenever possible.\\nWhen using an email to log on to a social media site, ensure your passwords for both are different. Don’t have similar passwords for your other social media accounts too.',\n",
       " 'Director Jis Joy’s next venture Mohan Kumar Fans will have yet another newbie stepping into Mollywood. The comedy drama, which has Kunchacko Boban in the lead, will introduce model Anarkali Nazar.\\n\\nFurther on her role, its director Jis tells us, “Anarkali’s character Sreeranjini is a singer who takes part in reality shows in the film. She is also a struggling interior designer.”\\n\\n\\nAnarkali, who was a civil engineering graduate, has worked for a while as an airline professional, before taking up modelling full time. On her debut film, she says, “I knew Jis sir earlier as I had worked with him for ads. When this opportunity came up, he called me and I was excited to give it a go. I am no singer in real life, but used to imitate and lip-sync for songs, for fun, while with friends. But thanks to the support of everyone in the crew, I believe I have given it my best.” The actress, who hails from Karunagappally, is also part of the upcoming Asif Ali movie Kunjeldho.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnarkali says working in her first film had its challenges too. “For instance, I have a dance sequence with Kunchacko Boban, who is seasoned dancer. I am not trained in dance and all I have done is shake a leg fot college events. But, the crew and Chackochan in particular were patient with me till I got steps right. As the set was quite supportive, in fact, I feel the shoot was like a breeze,” says the artiste.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe script of the film, which also stars Siddique, Krishna Sankar, Saiju Kurup, Vinay Forrt, Sreenivasan, Basil Joseph, is by Jis Joy and story by Bobby and Sanjay.

One of them was director TN Seetharam’s popular series, Magalu Janaki, which has prompted fans to debate this decision online. \"The viewers are hurt and I can empathise with their disappointment. But this is how things are as of now,\" says Seetharam. So, what led to this? \"The channel that is airing it is being suspended given the global economic slowdown. Moving the show to a sister concern channel isn\\'t as easy. It\\'s like me building a home in the site you have purchased. GEC officials have their TRP targets and programming schedules and I understand that,\" he says.\\n\\nSeetharam admits, though, that it took him a while to digest the news. \"I was told one morning, and at the time, I said, ‘Oh, is it? Ok.’ It took me a couple of hours to let it sink in and then, I was overwhelmed. I\\'ve been so involved with that story and I also thought of all the people, the technicians who worked on our show. What will happen to them?\" he asks.\\n\\n\\nBut given the uproar among his fans, with #MaraluJanaki (Return Janaki) trending on social media, would he consider making a return? \"I doubt that will happen, because October is when the channel officials are looking at some clarity on this. Six months is a long time to consider making a comeback,\" points out Seetharam.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the veteran director is already busy preparing for his next serial. \"It will be for another channel and will portray the life and times of a superstar.\" The theme? His trademark - a woman-oriented story.',\n",
       " 'Director Badri Venkatesh is planning a remake of the 1978 cult classic Aval Appadithan, which had Kamal Haasan and Sripriya in the lead roles with Rajinikanth playing a key role. Shruti Haasan is likely to play the role of Manju, made memorable by Sripriya. Names of Simbu and Dulquer Salmaan to play Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan’s characters, respectively, are also doing the rounds.\\n\\n“It all started when I took up a social media challenge and answered my niece, who is an American, that the soundtrack of Aval Appadithan resonates with me even today, and tagged Shruti Haasan,” begins Badri.\\n\\n\\n“I’m from the film institute, and this film, by C Rudhraiya, is the first film made by a graduate of the institute. So, it’s close to my heart for more reasons than one,” he continues, “I worked with Shruti Haasan in her show, Hello Sago, and had chatted with her about Aval Appadithan. She re-watched the film on my insistence. The film talks about so many issues that are extremely relevant today. I wanted to make the film again and Shruti was excited about the idea. We also have a producer on board.”\\n\\nBut there’s a problem — Badri doesn’t know who holds the rights to the original. “Rudhraiya is no more and I don’t think his daughter, who is in the US, also knows about it. I won’t be recreating the film frame by frame, but I want to start this project without any hindrance,” he states.\\n\\n\\nHas he reached out to Dulquer and Simbu for the remake? “The communication has reached Dulquer, but I haven’t spoken to Simbu yet. The film rests on Manju, and Shruti is game to play the role. I might get Dulquer or Vijay Deverakonda on board for the male lead. Though Yuvan Shankar Raja has composed music for all my films, I want to get Ilaiyaraaja sir to score the music for this one,” informs the director.',\n",
       " 'As we step into June 1, today, the reality that we might all have to go back to offices has sunk in. With restrictions easing in #Lockdown4.0 and offices opening up again in several parts of the country, India’s working class, which spent the first three weeks of the lockdown complaining about staying cooped up indoors, now find itself reluctant to step out of their homes after two months of working from home. Whether it is the idea of dressing up for work again or having to dedicate crucial hours from the day to driving through slow-moving traffic to reach office — working professionals tell us that they are dreading to go back to office mode and deal with the ‘new normal’.\\nMonday Blues are back\\nWhile working from home, most of us have lost track of days. With people spending their entire day at home, the line between weekday and weekend has blurred. With offices now opening up in several parts of India, many find themselves in need for #MondayMotivation yet again. Ruchi Jain, a financial consultant from a Pune-based company, says, “Having gone back to work last week, the hardest thing for me to do was to get up and go to work on Monday. With the rest of my family still working from home, finding the motivation to go to the office is extremely tough.” Ragini Dutta, who works at a Bengaluru-based advertising company, adds, “Earlier, I had something to look forward to when it came to weekends. But now, except offices, everything else is shut. There are no bars, restaurants or cinema halls. So after spending the weekend lazing at home, going back to office on Monday is the hardest.”\\n\\n\\nGetting ready for work never felt this hard Spending the summer wearing shorts at the workstation is a luxury none of us would’ve foreseen. After getting used to casual wear, barring the odd video-conference call, office-goers are having a tough time dressing up for work again. Naresh Yadav, who works at an insurance company, echoes this sentiment, “Over the last couple of months, I would get straight out of bed and go to my work station. Two pairs of t-shirts and a couple of shorts are all I needed. Now, even a simple thing like putting on formal shoes feels like a task. It’s so uncomfortable. I can’t find something as simple as my bike keys — I’m just confused and dazed while setting out for work in the morning now.”\\n\\nSleep cycle goes for a toss\\nBinge-watching shows till late in the night may not be an option anymore, rue office-goers. Those who have been asked to come in to work again tell us that readjusting their body clock has been one of their biggest challenges. Arghya Saha, who works at an event management firm in Delhi, says, “While working from home during the lockdown, I used to sleep at 3am and wake up late in the afternoon. Now, I’ve been asked to go to office and our shift timings have changed because of the 7pm curfew. I’m having a really tough time getting used to these new timings. What’s worse, we’re only going to office on alternate days and the rest of the time, I’m working from home. So my body clock is all over the place right now.”\\n\\nTraffic woes begin again!\\nFor many professionals, the best part about working from home was that it would save them precious time that they spent commuting. Easing of lockdown restrictions would mean the return of the dreaded traffic jams — and the commuters are not pleased. “I would spend two hours on commute every day. When I started working from home, I realised I have more time for myself and used it to work on my fitness. Now I’m dreading the traffic jams again. With most flyovers still shut, the traffic snarls are only going to get longer,” says Hyderabad-based techie, J Vishal Kumar.\\nManvendra Chauhan, a Delhi-based marketing professional, was stuck for over an hour at the Delhi-Noida border. “You need a government-issued pass to go to Noida, so getting to work was a nightmare. Spending all that time stuck in traffic made me realise how much simpler it was when we were working from home,” he says, agitatedly.\\n\\nCorona panic hits the roof\\nWith the number of coronavirus cases in India increasing by the day, employees are anxious about going back to work again and risking themselves and their families. Despite taking precautions, the risk of transmission still remains. Vimal Kumar, who is employed with a BPO service in Chennai, says his family wants him to request his office to extend WFH. “They are worried about the increasing number of positive cases. We used to visit clinics at least once a month as one of us would invariably fall ill. But that stopped after the lockdown; I guess it’s\\nbecause of home-cooked food and exercise. Now, even if I’m the only one who is going out, it is a matter of concern as even a slight fever might affect the other four members, including a four-year-old,” he explains.\\n\\nLiving at home, you get used to a certain lifestyle and sense of comfort. Breaking out of that shell and starting your work routine again is never easy. It’s natural to feel resistant at first\\n— Kartik Valipay, Ahmedabad-based psychologist\\n\\nInitially, I enjoyed being at home, But with the layoffs, there will be extra pressure on the remaining employees\\n\\n— R Senthil Kumar, regional sales officer of a hotel in Coimbatore\\n\\n\\nTill now, having coffee and tea with colleagues At office was a tradition, but now, even thinking about it sends me into a panic mode\\n\\n— Surbhi, corporate employee',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: In a joint operation conducted by the military intelligence and Delhi Police\\'s special cell, three staff members from the Pakistan high commission were apprehended red-handed while trying to exchange stolen classified documents, in a development that might further strain the already tense ties with the hostile neighbour.\\nThe men — Abid Hussain, Tahir Khan and Javed Hussain — have been found to be directly linked to the ISI. The two men were declared persona non grata by the foreign ministry and were asked to leave the country by Monday morning. The last time a Pakistani diplomatic staffer was expelled was in 2016.\\n\"The government has declared both these officials persona non grata for indulging in activities incompatible with their status as members of a diplomatic mission and asked them to leave the country within 24 hours,\" the MEA said in a statement.\\nIndia also registered a strong protest with Pakistan’s charge de affaires with regard to the activities of these officials against India’s national security. He was asked to ensure that no member of its diplomatic mission should indulge in activities inimical to India or behave in a manner incompatible with their diplomatic status.\\nAn FIR under sections of the Official Secrets Act has been registered.\\nPakistan rejected the charge of espionage against the staffers of its mission as \"false\" and \"unsubstantiated\" and termed their expulsion as violative of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Amid the strong likelihood of a tit-for-tat response, the foreign ministry in Islamabad alleged that its personnel were tortured and accused India of trying to restrict the space for Pakistani diplomats.\\nIt also said the action was a ploy to distract attention from the \"worsening situation and human rights violations\" in J&K and from the issues, external and internal, facing the BJP government. It also sought the intervention of the international community for ensuring peace and stability in South Asia.\\nSources in Delhi said the three Pakistanis were tracked down by cops when they had allegedly gone to meet a \"defence personnel\" near Arya Samaj Road in Karol Bagh to exchange some highly sensitive info.\\nIt was found that Abid Hussain (42) and Tahir Khan (44) were using fake Indian names and identity cards. They had travelled around the city in a car that was being driven by Javed Hussain.\\nSources said they were under the intel scanner for quite some time after they attempted to contact and lure some defence personnel into espionage-related activities.\\nThey were caught with some incriminating documents along with Rs 15,000 and two iPhones, one which they wanted to give to the informant.\\nDuring interrogation, the men claimed they were under diplomatic immunity but were not found to be so. They claimed to be in touch with a number of people who were providing them sensitive information about military deployments.\\nEfforts are being made to track down the informants as well. The agencies are probing whether other staff members from the high commission were also involved in the spying racket.\\nA report regarding the interrogation was sent to the MEA. After registering an FIR, the men were sent for a medical examination and then handed over to the high commission.\\nSources said Abid Hussain was posted as a visa assistant since December 2018, while Tahir Khan was an upper division clerk who came to India around the same time. Javed Hussain was working as a driver for the past five and a half years.\\nIn 2016, Delhi Police had busted another spy ring comprising more than a dozen officials from the Pakistan high commission after they caught a staffer, Mehmood Akhtar, who was retrieving data about BSF deployments along the Indo-Pak border. Following this, 16 staff members from the high commission were expelled after they were found to be obtaining information from different sources. After that, the ISI had been been using its agents posted in Pakistan\\'s missions in neighbouring countries of Mauritius and Sri Lanka to organise espionage and subversion in India, sources said.']"

While Manvitha and Ashika had a message that appeared to be of Turkish origin on the landing page, the hacker in Vasishta’s case was closer home, Mulbagal in Karnataka, and had been pretending to be the actor to chat with ‘fans’.\\nTHE ROAD TO RECOVERY\\n\\nThe actors sought expert help to retrieve their accounts and changed passwords and other personal log in details. In Ashika’s case, it was even quicker, as she had a two-factor authentication process lined up, which alerted her about some unusual activity.\\n\\nUPPING SECURITY FEATURES All three have since upped the security settings on their social media accounts with two-factor authentication to prevent future hacking possibilities.\\n\\nMEANWHILE, CYBER CRIME ON THE RISE, SAYS TOP COP\\n\\nBengaluru city commissioner of police Bhaskar Rao tells us, “There has been a spike in the rate of cybercrimes since the lockdown. Everyone is indoors, so the scope for physical crime isn’t as much. Instead, there are criminals lurking online. Just as you have locks for the doors and windows to prevent thefts at home, your internet activity needs to be completely secure to allow no one to enter.”\\n\\n\\nHacking of celeb accounts on the rise\\n\\nActor Dhruva Sarja’s wife Prerana’s Instagram handle has been renamed Instagramcentrecopyight for over a fortnight now.

The comedy drama, which has Kunchacko Boban in the lead, will introduce model Anarkali Nazar.\\n\\nFurther on her role, its director Jis tells us, “Anarkali’s character Sreeranjini is a singer who takes part in reality shows in the film. She is also a struggling interior designer.”\\n\\n\\nAnarkali, who was a civil engineering graduate, has worked for a while as an airline professional, before taking up modelling full time. On her debut film, she says, “I knew Jis sir earlier as I had worked with him for ads. When this opportunity came up, he called me and I was excited to give it a go. I am no singer in real life, but used to imitate and lip-sync for songs, for fun, while with friends. But thanks to the support of everyone in the crew, I believe I have given it my best.” The actress, who hails from Karunagappally, is also part of the upcoming Asif Ali movie Kunjeldho.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnarkali says working in her first film had its challenges too. “For instance, I have a dance sequence with Kunchacko Boban, who is seasoned dancer. I am not trained in dance and all I have done is shake a leg fot college events. But, the crew and Chackochan in particular were patient with me till I got steps right. As the set was quite supportive, in fact, I feel the shoot was like a breeze,” says the artiste.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe script of the film, which also stars Siddique, Krishna Sankar, Saiju Kurup, Vinay Forrt, Sreenivasan, Basil Joseph, is by Jis Joy and story by Bobby and Sanjay.

       " 'In the two months of lockdown, many tele-serials became casualties of the impact it had on GEC programming. One of them was director TN Seetharam’s popular series, Magalu Janaki, which has prompted fans to debate this decision online. \"The viewers are hurt and I can empathise with their disappointment. But this is how things are as of now,\" says Seetharam. So, what led to this? \"The channel that is airing it is being suspended given the global economic slowdown. Moving the show to a sister concern channel isn\\'t as easy. It\\'s like me building a home in the site you have purchased. GEC officials have their TRP targets and programming schedules and I understand that,\" he says.\\n\\nSeetharam admits, though, that it took him a while to digest the news. \"I was told one morning, and at the time, I said, ‘Oh, is it? Ok.’ It took me a couple of hours to let it sink in and then, I was overwhelmed. I\\'ve been so involved with that story and I also thought of all the people, the technicians who worked on our show. What will happen to them?\" he asks.\\n\\n\\nBut given the uproar among his fans, with #MaraluJanaki (Return Janaki) trending on social media, would he consider making a return? \"I doubt that will happen, because October is when the channel officials are looking at some clarity on this. Six months is a long time to consider making a comeback,\" points out Seetharam.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the veteran director is already busy preparing for his next serial. \"It will be for another channel and will portray the life and times of a superstar.\" The theme?

Shruti Haasan is likely to play the role of Manju, made memorable by Sripriya. Names of Simbu and Dulquer Salmaan to play Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan’s characters, respectively, are also doing the rounds.\\n\\n“It all started when I took up a social media challenge and answered my niece, who is an American, that the soundtrack of Aval Appadithan resonates with me even today, and tagged Shruti Haasan,” begins Badri.\\n\\n\\n“I’m from the film institute, and this film, by C Rudhraiya, is the first film made by a graduate of the institute. So, it’s close to my heart for more reasons than one,” he continues, “I worked with Shruti Haasan in her show, Hello Sago, and had chatted with her about Aval Appadithan. She re-watched the film on my insistence. The film talks about so many issues that are extremely relevant today. I wanted to make the film again and Shruti was excited about the idea. We also have a producer on board.”\\n\\nBut there’s a problem — Badri doesn’t know who holds the rights to the original. “Rudhraiya is no more and I don’t think his daughter, who is in the US, also knows about it. I won’t be recreating the film frame by frame, but I want to start this project without any hindrance,” he states.\\n\\n\\nHas he reached out to Dulquer and Simbu for the remake? “The communication has reached Dulquer, but I haven’t spoken to Simbu yet. The film rests on Manju, and Shruti is game to play the role. I might get Dulquer or Vijay Deverakonda on board for the male lead. Though Yuvan Shankar Raja has composed music for all my films, I want to get Ilaiyaraaja sir to score the music for this one,” informs the director.',\n",
       " 'As we step into June 1, today, the reality that we might all have to go back to offices has sunk in. With restrictions easing in #Lockdown4.0 and offices opening up again in several parts of the country, India’s working class, which spent the first three weeks of the lockdown complaining about staying cooped up indoors, now find itself reluctant to step out of their homes after two months of working from home. Whether it is the idea of dressing up for work again or having to dedicate crucial hours from the day to driving through slow-moving traffic to reach office — working professionals tell us that they are dreading to go back to office mode and deal with the ‘new normal’.\\nMonday Blues are back\\nWhile working from home, most of us have lost track of days. With people spending their entire day at home, the line between weekday and weekend has blurred. With offices now opening up in several parts of India, many find themselves in need for #MondayMotivation yet again. Ruchi Jain, a financial consultant from a Pune-based company, says, “Having gone back to work last week, the hardest thing for me to do was to get up and go to work on Monday. With the rest of my family still working from home, finding the motivation to go to the office is extremely tough.” Ragini Dutta, who works at a Bengaluru-based advertising company, adds, “Earlier, I had something to look forward to when it came to weekends. But now, except offices, everything else is shut. There are no bars, restaurants or cinema halls. So after spending the weekend lazing at home, going back to office on Monday is the hardest.”\\n\\n\\nGetting ready for work never felt this hard Spending the summer wearing shorts at the workstation is a luxury none of us would’ve foreseen. After getting used to casual wear, barring the odd video-conference call, office-goers are having a tough time dressing up for work again. Naresh Yadav, who works at an insurance company, echoes this sentiment, “Over the last couple of months, I would get straight out of bed and go to my work station. Two pairs of t-shirts and a couple of shorts are all I needed. Now, even a simple thing like putting on formal shoes feels like a task. It’s so uncomfortable. I can’t find something as simple as my bike keys — I’m just confused and dazed while setting out for work in the morning now.”\\n\\nSleep cycle goes for a toss\\nBinge-watching shows till late in the night may not be an option anymore, rue office-goers. Those who have been asked to come in to work again tell us that readjusting their body clock has been one of their biggest challenges. Arghya Saha, who works at an event management firm in Delhi, says, “While working from home during the lockdown, I used to sleep at 3am and wake up late in the afternoon. Now, I’ve been asked to go to office and our shift timings have changed because of the 7pm curfew. I’m having a really tough time getting used to these new timings. What’s worse, we’re only going to office on alternate days and the rest of the time, I’m working from home. So my body clock is all over the place right now.”\\n\\nTraffic woes begin again!\\nFor many professionals, the best part about working from home was that it would save them precious time that they spent commuting. Easing of lockdown restrictions would mean the return of the dreaded traffic jams — and the commuters are not pleased. “I would spend two hours on commute every day. When I started working from home, I realised I have more time for myself and used it to work on my fitness. Now I’m dreading the traffic jams again. With most flyovers still shut, the traffic snarls are only going to get longer,” says Hyderabad-based techie, J Vishal Kumar.\\nManvendra Chauhan, a Delhi-based marketing professional, was stuck for over an hour at the Delhi-Noida border. “You need a government-issued pass to go to Noida, so getting to work was a nightmare. Spending all that time stuck in traffic made me realise how much simpler it was when we were working from home,” he says, agitatedly.\\n\\nCorona panic hits the roof\\nWith the number of coronavirus cases in India increasing by the day, employees are anxious about going back to work again and risking themselves and their families. Despite taking precautions, the risk of transmission still remains. Vimal Kumar, who is employed with a BPO service in Chennai, says his family wants him to request his office to extend WFH. “They are worried about the increasing number of positive cases. We used to visit clinics at least once a month as one of us would invariably fall ill. But that stopped after the lockdown; I guess it’s\\nbecause of home-cooked food and exercise. Now, even if I’m the only one who is going out, it is a matter of concern as even a slight fever might affect the other four members, including a four-year-old,” he explains.\\n\\nLiving at home, you get used to a certain lifestyle and sense of comfort. Breaking out of that shell and starting your work routine again is never easy. It’s natural to feel resistant at first\\n— Kartik Valipay, Ahmedabad-based psychologist\\n\\nInitially, I enjoyed being at home, But with the layoffs, there will be extra pressure on the remaining employees\\n\\n— R Senthil Kumar, regional sales officer of a hotel in Coimbatore\\n\\n\\nTill now, having coffee and tea with colleagues At office was a tradition, but now, even thinking about it sends me into a panic mode\\n\\n— Surbhi, corporate employee',\n",

The last time a Pakistani diplomatic staffer was expelled was in 2016.\\n\"The government has declared both these officials persona non grata for indulging in activities incompatible with their status as members of a diplomatic mission and asked them to leave the country within 24 hours,\" the MEA said in a statement.\\nIndia also registered a strong protest with Pakistan’s charge de affaires with regard to the activities of these officials against India’s national security. He was asked to ensure that no member of its diplomatic mission should indulge in activities inimical to India or behave in a manner incompatible with their diplomatic status.\\nAn FIR under sections of the Official Secrets Act has been registered.\\nPakistan rejected the charge of espionage against the staffers of its mission as \"false\" and \"unsubstantiated\" and termed their expulsion as violative of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Amid the strong likelihood of a tit-for-tat response, the foreign ministry in Islamabad alleged that its personnel were tortured and accused India of trying to restrict the space for Pakistani diplomats.\\nIt also said the action was a ploy to distract attention from the \"worsening situation and human rights violations\" in J&K and from the issues, external and internal, facing the BJP government.

The agencies are probing whether other staff members from the high commission were also involved in the spying racket.\\nA report regarding the interrogation was sent to the MEA. After registering an FIR, the men were sent for a medical examination and then handed over to the high commission.\\nSources said Abid Hussain was posted as a visa assistant since December 2018, while Tahir Khan was an upper division clerk who came to India around the same time. Javed Hussain was working as a driver for the past five and a half years.\\nIn 2016, Delhi Police had busted another spy ring comprising more than a dozen officials from the Pakistan high commission after they caught a staffer, Mehmood Akhtar, who was retrieving data about BSF deployments along the Indo-Pak border. Following this, 16 staff members from the high commission were expelled after they were found to be obtaining information from different sources.

The Covid-19 outbreak has pushed people involved in all these practices into a precarious situation. Although Sandalwood identifies itself as an industry, when it comes to government funds, it is often left out,” he says, adding, “The Kannada and Cultural Department doesn’t consider us cultural warriors, who need financial support. Even the Labour Department turns a blind eye to the problems that workers in these industries are facing. We are also not entitled to any dedicated social security schemes. Every year, the government receives crores of rupees from the film and television industries as taxes. But during a crisis like this, we are termed an unorganised sector. We need to be recognised under a separate cultural wing, so that policies can be formulated for the benefit of film and TV workers.”\\n\\nThe filmmaker has requested for a meeting with Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa to discuss and submit the petition, which has, so far, been signed by P Sheshadri, TS Nagabharana and B Suresha, among others.',\n",

But will malls still hold the same charm, or will anxiety and fear prompt us to think twice before we step inside one?\\nMunish Khanna, Chief Revenue Officer of Express Avenue, says it’s all about rediscovering fun in a safe way. “We have a strict sanitisation process in place. When you first enter a mall, your vehicles will be sanitised. Apart from doing a thermal check and ensuring you have your mask on, we’ll also see if you’ve downloaded the Arogya Setu app. We’ll limit shoppers inside an elevator, and also make sure they maintain a gap of two steps on escalators. Even in the washrooms, only alternate washbasins and urinals will be in use,” he says, “You can order food from an app or online, pay from your digital wallet and the food will be delivered to you at your table in the food court.

Also, initially, we are only looking at eight or nine hours of operation.”\\nDespite these safety measures, won’t there be fear and anxiety in the minds of people?

Tanvi’s dad, Sanjeev adds that the initiative is an incredible way to make children look forward to something during these testing times.\\n\\nFor Bangalore girl Aadya, 8, this competition became a pathway to discover the world of Harry Potter and keep family traditions going. “I am a huge Harry Potter fan. So, I introduced my daughter to the Harry Potter films this summer. This is when I chanced upon the Ickabog challenge, and suggested we make it her bedtime read. Aadya was thrilled when she saw Rowling’s response, although she made it clear that she was expecting an answer from Harry Potter,” laughs Aadya’s mother, Varsha. Such initiatives ride home the fact that everyone is in this fight together, Varsha says.\\n\\nBollywood filmmaker Hansal Mehta’s daughters Kimaya and Rihanna, too, were among the kids whose works Rowling appreciated, and Mehta and his wife Safeena, were pleasantly surprised. “The girls and I were over the moon when Hansal showed us the tweet. This is a great motivation for them to put their reading glasses on, because Rowling is such an idol for kids,” says Safeena.\\n\\n\\n“From lockdown in Scotland to lockdown in India, I must say that these are some of the best pictures I’ve seen!” Rowling’s note to Hansal’s tweet read. When Kimaya, 14, sat out in her garden to pen these sketches along with her younger sister Rihanna, and their friends Vihaan and Ashreta, a few days ago, she never imagined Rowling to respond to their sketches.\\n\\n\\n“Lockdown has been quite boring, these past couple of weeks. This competition gave us the opportunity to explore Rowling’s writing through art,” Kimaya adds.\\n\\n\\nRediscovering The Ickabog\\n\\nOver 10 years ago, JK Rowling conceived The Ickabog, which became a bedtime hit with her two younger children. But soon, she shelved the book to focus on other work. This year, however, the author was tempted to revisit the novel. “Over the years, I came to think of it as something that was just for my own children. Then, this lockdown happened. It’s been very hard on children, in particular, so I brought The Ickabog down from the attic, read it for the first time in years, rewrote bits of it and then read it to my children again,” the author writes on the book’s website. Ever since May 26, the Harry Potter writer has been releasing chapters from her children’s novel The Ickabog for free online. Rowling’s royalties of the book will further be donated to people affected by the pandemic.\",\n",

The final rites were conducted yesterday in the presence of family members and a few close friends. Condolence messages poured in from the music fraternity as well as actors and filmmakers, who Wajid had worked with over the years.\\nBrothers Sajid and Wajid came from a family that is rooted in music. Their father Ustad Sharafat Ali Khan was a tabla player. The two composers, who made their Bollywood debut with Salman Khan’s film Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya (1998), have been close to the actor. Their 22-year-long journey in the world of music saw them composing many hit tracks for films, including Chori Chori (2003), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Partner (2007), Dabangg (2010), Rowdy Rathore (2012), Ek Tha Tiger (2012) and Satyameva Jayate (2018).\\n\\nRecalling how Wajid and he started their careers together, Sonu Nigam says, “We knew each other since our struggling days. While I used to wait outside recording studios, he had access to these places as he belonged to a musical family. Sajid and he composed the music for my album Deewana, and I have sung several songs for them over the years. They are like family to me. I knew Wajid from the time he was dating his wife. In fact, whenever they had minor fights, like most couples do, I would mediate between them.”\\nBesides composing music for Salman’s films, Sajid-Wajid recently gave the music for his single, Bhai Bhai, which the actor released amidst the lockdown on the occasion of Eid. Alka Yagnik says, “I had sung many songs for Wajid, including some for Salman’s film Hello Brother. Wajid looked up to Salman Khan, who was like his godfather. Wajid was full of life and a prankster. He would crack jokes during our recordings, too. In fact, I had to scold him at times and say, ‘Wajid, ab kaam khatam karte hain.’ He was a good singer, too.”\\n\\nSinger and composer Adnan Sami, who knew Wajid for over 20 years, had met him last at his residence for dinner a few months ago. He said, “I had invited many of my friends from the industry for dinner. We had a great time catching up. The first song that I recorded for him, was the qawwali, Ruthe Yaar Nu Mana Le for the film, Chori Chori. My first meeting with him set the tone for the wonderful relationship that we shared over the years. He had a lot of josh for life.”\\n\\nLike Sonu and Adnan, singer-minister Babul Supriyo has had a long association with Wajid, too. He shares, “A few months ago, when I was in Mumbai, Sajid, Wajid, Shaan and I spent quality time discussing music over a lot of food at Shaan’s home. I also spoke to him a month ago about his kidney transplant and told him to take rest. His death is a big loss to the music industry.”\\n\\nRemembering the composer, Shaan says, “We would play cricket together and were great buddies. I remember many things about him… like how he got my kids to sing. He said, ‘Arre bacche gaa rahein hain? Chalo, I should be the first to give them a song’. Wajid created a situation in the film Himmatwala (2013) and got my sons to sing a song along with me. Since 2010, Sajid-Wajid made sure that I was a part of most of their projects. Wajid was someone who would always look out for a friend.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSajid and Wajid, who made their debut as music directors with 'Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya', have composed music together for 22 years\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReplyForward\",\n",

Especially so, when it comes to shooting large family sequences like weddings and parties, which are an integral part of our daily soaps.\\n‘Technology To The Rescue’\\nJD Majethia, producer of 'Bhakharwadi', says, “Family dramas can’t go out of fashion, but with the new rules, we will have to tweak our screenplay so that not everyone is together in one frame. Also, we will have to make some amends in the way we function. There will be rehearsals on how to work on a set. We have not worked in such an environment, so there is no road map. We intend to exchange notes with each other and ensure that the industry comes together and work progresses smoothly with minimum or no casualty from COVID-19.”\\n\\n\\n‘Focus on individual problems’ While families and their problems hogged the limelight earlier, writers will now focus on individual problems. Writer-producer Amir Jaffar says, “While there is no restriction on the number of actors on a set, we will have to impose certain restrictions at our end, too. We won’t have too many actors in one frame and will have to make do with cutaways. For now, the writing will focus on individual problems rather than family issues.”\\n\\n‘There is no budget for extravagant sequences’\\nWith the economic upheaval, the makers will also have to work on a tight budget. Amir adds, “Extravagant events, like weddings and festivals, require a lot of money to be shot. I don’t think any broadcaster is in a mood or position to spend that kind of money on a sequence. So, wedding and party sequences will be on hold till normalcy returns.”\\n\\n‘Necessity is the mother of all inventions’\\n\\nHowever, Binaifer Kohli, producer of 'Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hain', is still hopeful about retaining the essence of family dramas. She says, “We can show a court marriage. If not that, we can show four people on the mandap and another few outside, but shot separately. We will find ways to work things out and producers will find innovative ways to execute it. Necessity is the mother of all inventions. Our priority right now is to ensure that everyone on the set is safe.”\\n\\n\\n‘TV shows are a reflection of the society’\\n\\nOn his part, producer Asit Kumarr Modi is prepared to keep up with changing times. The storyline of his show, 'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah', will be written in accordance with the new normal. He says, “TV is a reflection of society. If we can’t organise grand weddings in real life, we will have to show that on reel as well. Festivals will be celebrated at home like it is being done in real life. We will make some alterations in the story, but make sure that the audience doesn’t find it jarring. So, even if we are shooting with the cast separately, it shouldn’t show on screen.”\\n\\n\\n‘Content will be more story-driven at this point’\\n\\nMeanwhile, broadcasters are also ensuring that the industry gets back on its feet as quickly as possible. Manisha Sharma, Chief Content Officer of a Hindi GEC, says, “We will be abiding by the guidelines that include wearing masks, regular sanitisation of the sets and temperature checks, individual safety measures, categorisation of crew members and social distancing when we resume shoots. Our content will be more story-driven at this point. High points and bigger sequences will be planned in the due course, when the situation is more favourable. Our prime focus at this point is to create a sense of normalcy while keeping the business afloat and our viewers engaged.”\",\n",

       " 'For para swimmer-turned-actor Vishwas KS, life in the first half of the lockdown was nothing less than a nightmare. The swimmer had no access to essential services. He says that very little was done by the government for the differently-abled community. Vishwas, who has won medals at various national and international events, is making his debut in Sandalwood with his biopic, Arbbie, which highlights his journey as a swimmer with no arms.\\nVishwas says, “I was living alone when the lockdown was imposed. Movement was restricted and I had to struggle to get my meals. I was relying on hotels for food and they were closed. Groceries were available, but it was difficult for me to cook by myself. To go outside, I have to depend on other people, which was again not possible due to the lockdown rules. I survived on instant noodles until some relaxations were announced by the government. Being a swimmer, I couldn’t get the required calories to keep my body in shape.”\\nVishwas further says that after the lockdown, it will be a different world for the physically challenged, especially those who are living independently. “There are no particular norms for disabled people in the current situation. Just imagine if a physically-challenged person needs to board a train without any help. He/she has to rely on other people, but how do they help when there is social distancing? If a visually-impaired person needs to cross a busy road, he can’t do it with anyone else. Now people are living in fear of the pandemic, so they might think twice to help out,” he adds.',\n",

       " 'India is weathering an economic crisis, like the rest of the world and so are leading brands, who have temporarily lost their customers to the pandemic. And, in order to provide some relief to the customers, brands and retailers have requested the malls to close the commercial agreements with reduced rents with reference to the trading density of the malls.\\nAccording to a report published by IANS, a formula has been proposed in order to simplify the process and speed up the discussions, called as the Red-Orange-Green approach that will distribute the burden.\\n\\nThe report cites that red is the lockdown period in which the proposal is a complete waiver of rent and CAM (common area maintenance) charges and cancellation of invoices that have been raised, while orange is the period post-lockdown when business is below normal. A variable model wherein the rent plus CAMs is based on the trading density of the mall, so if the entire mall is trading at 70 per cent of LY levels then rent plus CAM for all tenants signatory to this letter, becomes 70 per cent of LY levels.\\nGreen, on the other hand is the period when business gets back to normal. As soon as the trading density of the entire mall sustainably touches 100 per cent of LY levels, rent plus CAM terms will switch back to pre-Covid terms.\\n\\nThe report suggests that when contacted, the Retailers Association of India (RAI) suggested the retailers are having a direct dialogue with malls on the issue.\\n\\n\"Retailers and malls are currently engaged on this issue and a mutually acceptable arrangement is yet to be reached. The brands seem to be petitioning the malls in their individual capacity but raising common issues on the applicable rent,\" mentions the report.\\n\\nRetailers had written to the malls in the second week of April 2020 wherein relevant signatories of the said communication had appealed to for a complete waiver of rent and CAM for the period of Covid-19 led lockdown and for a reduced rent for a period of 9 months post the opening of the lockdown.\\n\\n“All signatories have also independently and directly communicated the same appeal to you and explained the compelling circumstances and context related to the same,” as per the letter sent by the retailers.\\n\\n“We regret to note however that we have still not been able to arrive at a mutually acceptable arrangement on the above. This despite the fact that retailers and their association have gone out of their way towards advocacy with govt agencies for a support package for malls. As a result of these efforts, we understand that you have received a moratorium of minimum 6 months on LRDs and also malls are expected to be allowed to open soon. We will continue to make these efforts with a win-win mindset,” the retailers added.\\n\\nRetailers have pointed out that they will soon be confronted with the humongous tasks of re-opening malls and stores, bringing customers back and ensuring the safety of all involved during day-to-day operations.\\n\\nRetailers and brands have to additionally deal with massive accumulation of inventories, unprecedented disruption in manufacturing and supply chain, and the huge shift of customers to e-commerce, amongst other things.\\n\\n\\n“We urge you once again to precipitate closure of commercial arrangements with the signatories of this letter so that we can have a timely and smooth opening of our operations in your mall,” they added.\\n\\n\\n“The Government of India, the Supreme Court and various authorities across the world have acknowledged that the Pandemic is a difficult time for all businesses and individuals. Governments have taken significant steps to provide relief to ensure viability of livelihood. We appeal to your sensibility to provide support to retailers and brands to overcome to impact of the pandemic and make retail trade viable for the future,” it said.\\n\\n\\nWith inputs from IANS',\n",

I write my lyrics in English, and I am also planning to release it in Tamil and Telugu,” he says.\\n\\nSid flew back to the US since his shows here got cancelled.

But whenever we get back to performing, be it at intimate concerts or large ones, the feeling is going to be beautiful,” he smiles.\\n\\nHis songs have turned out to be chartbusters.

Mani Ratnam sir, Dhana and I wanted to create a sonic space that would juxtapose against this film and the visual to create something you wouldn’t expect to hear.

So much so, Mumbai will see 24\\nbicycle councillors taking charge of a ward to make it cycle-friendly starting from today, on World Bicycle Day. Here’s looking at why this two-wheeler is seen as a safe alternative for a traffic-heavy and congested city as ours...\\n‘A cycle is the best way to have a personal vehicle and keep social distance’\\nIf you have always treated cycling as just a hobby in Mumbai, it may just turn out to be a lifesaver now. A report quotes Morton Kabell, who co-chairs the European Cyclists’ Federation, as saying that the transition to bike-friendly urban environments “is necessary if we want our cities to work”. Bicycle Mayor of Mumbai, Firoza Suresh, endorses it, saying, “The air quality has improved drastically in Mumbai during the 60-day lockdown. Do we want to go back to the old ways of taking motorised transportation for short commutes? Why not cycle, instead?”\\nAcross the globe, there is an active post-lockdown focus on cycling. “With concerns arising about shared mobility (app-based cabs) and the need to keep social distance, a cycle is the best way to have your own personal vehicle and keep a distance from others on the road. Besides, it also reduces carbon emission and does not increase pollution levels,” she adds.\\n‘Bicycle councillors have the task of making each ward cycle-friendly’\\n\\nTo move towards a greater cycle usage, Mumbai will soon have ‘bicycle councillors’. “Each ward of MMR (Mumbai Metropolitan Region), which are 24 in number, will have a bicycle councillor. They’ll be designated with the task of making their ward cycle-friendly. We wanted to start the process on June 3 as it is celebrated as World Bicycle Day,” informs Firoza Suresh.\\nFor some, the cycle has been a boon during lockdown. Take Mumbai’s frontline healthcare workers. Says Dr Viswanathan Iyer, brain and spine surgeon, “I’ve always been a cyclist, but in lockdown it became a necessity as I had to visit different hospitals in Thane and Ghatkopar from Mulund. It's also a safe mode of transport. People should think of adapting to it and use it to travel up to 10kms, which is something anyone can do.”\\n\\nSalman Khan ko cycling pasand hai\\nLockdown or no lockdown, Salman Khan just needs a reason to go pedalling on his cycle — be it to Mehboob Studio, the shooting set near his apartment, or to visit his starry neighbour, Shah Rukh Khan. In fact, the actor was spotted cycling around his Panvel farmhouse, where he’s been throughout the lockdown. His friends, including Jacqueline Fernandez, who are also at the farmhouse, were seen cycling with him. The cycling brigade in tinseltown also includes SRK, Sonakshi Sinha, Sidharth Malhotra and Kalki Koechlin among others.\\nThis will help curb pollution: Iqbal khan\\n“I have two cars, but now, I use them mainly for long-distance travel. My sole purpose to buy a bicycle was to help curb pollution and traffic congestion. So, If I want to go to the gym or my local grocery shop or buy veggies, I use the bicycle. I used to love riding it before the lockdown. After things open up now, I will begin using it again for short distances.”\",\n",

       " 'The connection of sex and a glowing skin has always been a thing to talk about, thanks to Indian movies and octogenarian aunties one bumps into at Indian weddings, who always give the sexual act some credit for a woman\\'s healthy looking skin. Well, in our quest to find out whether there is an actual relation between the two, we came across a study that will surprise you.\\n\\nFor all those people who have always maintained that a good sex life leads to a brighter skin and shinier hair, there\\'s a piece of good news - it\\'s true. And hey, we are not saying that but a team of researchers have concluded a connection between sex and beauty.\\n\\n\\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, carried out by researchers at the University of Michigan, having an orgasm raises the levels of estrogen in your body and since estrogen delays ageing, sex - in a way keeps your skin young, moist and also ups your collagen levels, which in turn keep your skin firm and soft.\\n\\n\\nSo, how does sex actually make your skin glow? Well, it turns out that post-sex afterglow is a thing of reality and not dreams. The study cites that engaging in sex leads ups the heart rate, causing blood flow to increase rapidly. And, that means there\\'s more oxygen flowing in your body which in turn gives you a more glowing and vibrant skin.\\n\\n\\nAnother study, The Health Benefits of Sexual Expression, conducted over 10 years and involving more than 3,500 women and men examined various factors associated with youthful appearance. The study states, \"A panel of judges viewed the participants through a one-way mirror and then guessed the age of each subject. Those women and men whose age was regularly underestimated by seven to 12 years were labeled “superyoung.” Among these “superyoung” people, one of the strongest correlates of youthful appearance was an active sex life.\"',\n",
       " \"While most of her peers were active on social media, Manvita Kamath chose to spend her time in lockdown honing her writing skills. The actress, who wants to try her hand at direction someday, has been fuelling the writer within and hopes to wear the hat of a director too, someday. Fresh out of an ordeal where her Instagram account was hacked, Manvita sat down for a video chat with Bangalore Times, talking to us about her Marathi debut, wanting to open a food truck and many more plans for the future... You haven't shared pics or videos from your time during the lockdown...\\nI did a few live sessions in the beginning, but realised that people weren't too keen on watching it. To be honest, right now life is unpredictable and being on social media doesn't help. I want to concentrate on myself and have taken some 'me time'. I don't want to put myself on social media so much right now, because I want to reflect on myself, my purpose and career. I want to spread positivity and social media has a lot of negativity right now.\\nAny learnings from the recent episode where your Instagram account was hacked?\\n\\nThat was a scary episode. There was a verified profile that was hacked before mine and I got a link from it that looked authentic. I clicked on it because it spoke about copyright issues. It made me realise hackers can replicate anything. I filled a form and gave my confidential information, which wasn't the right thing to do. I would request everyone to be careful and not fall for anything even if it comes from a verified account.\\nHow did you start writing? My dad used to write a lot - both in English and Kannada. He used to pass his writings to me and I have tried to replicate that. I figured that I could write for films too. My writing has always been a little novelistic, but I realise I can change it to suit the screen and this is a learning process.\\nWhat kind of stories you are writing? And do you plan to direct as well?\\nDirection too, is on the cards. But it needs a lot of work. It is not something one can just jump into. Right now, I want to concentrate on my writing. Once my script is ready to be turned into a full-length feature film, then I would pitch it to a producer. I have been in talks with people form the industry with whom I have shared my writing. I will take up directing later. Cinema is not just my passion, but my life. I take cinema very seriously, so I would like to ace each aspect that I want to get into. I want to prepare well.\\nDo you express better in your writing or acting?\\nActing of course. If you have an actor within you and you have observed life very closely, you can be a good actor. You can be a good writer only if you travel, interact with people and are able to draw inspiration from others. That's why I travel a lot. I have no savings and I spend all my earnings on my travels. My mother tells me to save for the future, but I am someone who lives in the present. That is why I am not able to draw inspiration from anything right now because I am stuck inside my house. But OTT platforms have helped. I watched a lot of series and films and have learnt a lot from there.\\nYou recently dubbed for Rajasthan Diaries, your debut in Marathi. Tell us about the film...\\nI'm head over heels in love with the project. The experience I gained was amazing. I worked as an assistant director and would always hover around my director learning new techniques. I got the opportunity to work with a lot of technicians. It felt good to resume work because I was at home for almost 75 days. I was waiting to get back to work. I am very excited with the project.\\n\\nIn Shiva 143, you played an antagonist. Did you have any apprehensions?\\nAs an actor, Shiva 143 was a challenge. It made me understand scenes and scenarios in a better way. I play the antagonist and I had never played an evil, scheming, devilish person. I had to step into a new character, which was challenging. But playing an antagonist is fun and I want to do it again.\\n\\nTell us a little about your cooking escapades during the lockdown...\\n\\nI feel cooking and cinema are the purest forms of art. When you cook, you put so any ingredients and there is the aroma and you invite people to serve the food you have made. When people enjoy this, that makes my day. I want to open a food truck in the future and I will serve South Indian as I specialise in namma Karnataka cuisine.\",\n",
       " \"Television show 'Vidya' will not return to the small screen post the lockdown. The channel has decided to axe the serial, which started in September 2019. The storyline is at a crucial point where the titular character, played by Meera Deosthale, was about to give her exams and later fulfil her dream of becoming a teacher.\\n\\nTalking to BT, Meera said that she was not surprised by the development. She said, “After hearing about so many shows being axed, this is not surprising. We are all victims of COVID-19 and we have to face the situation. The show was at an interesting point and it also conveyed social messages on the importance of education, and against superstitions. It was an enjoyable journey. In this situation, we can only be positive and hope that things improve soon.”\\n\\n\\nNamish Taneja, who played the male lead, added, “Given the way the lockdown has impacted the industry, something like this was expected. I feel sad, as it was a good role. I hope that all the technicians, who lost their jobs due to this decision, get some new project soon.”\\n\\nHowever, producer Mahesh Pandey is shocked by the channel’s decision. He said, “On June 1, I was told that 'Vidya' will be axed. I am shocked! Why have they taken such a decision suddenly? COVID-19 has led to the premature demise of our show. 'Vidya’s story is incomplete and I wanted some more time for it, but now, there is no option left.”\",\n",

Just like getting immersed into my characters, with wildlife, what started out as a curiosity has now become a passion.”\\n\\n\\nThat’s also why the actress, who has been a jungle junkie for six years now, is missing that side of her during the lockdown. For her, the safaris and treks enabled her to gather stories and explore the forests. “The wilderness is a magical place,” she says. “I desire to work for wildlife and understand more about the body language of animals; for instance, how a tiger communicates with its tail. Initially, what fascinated me are the signals the other animals give when the big cats are out on the prowl. I have now learnt to recognise these calls.”\\n\\nPictures clicked by Srinda\\n\\nAsk her about her first encounter with the big cats and she says, “I can’t forget the first time I spotted a leopard. It was dark and I thought it was just a shadow. It was so close to us.” The time she first saw a tiger in its natural habitat was also unforgettable, Srinda gushes. “I had been craving to see one for a long time and finally spotted one through the bushes. It was a majestic sight to watch it lay there in all its poise. We spotted three tigers that day. I was so engrossed that I even forgot to click photos,” she says.\\n\\n\\nHer love for the wildlife began with safaris, and since then she has been exploring the forests of South India. “Each state’s forest has a different topography and a unique feel. I have made friends at these places including wildlife experts. I’m planning to join them when things get settled,” says Srinda, adding that she has also been shooting wildlife videos.',\n",

       " 'Paras Chhabra, who was one of the strongest contenders on ‘Bigg Boss 13’, had garnered a lot of attention on the show for two reasons — his volatile equation with Shehnaz Gill, and his strong friendship with Mahira Sharma. Interestingly, even months after the reality show has ended, his association with the two actresses continues to make news.\\nTo begin with, while the actors themselves have moved on with their lives and career, their fans are often seen indulging in social media wars. Talking about Shehnaz and her fans, Paras says, “What do I say about Shehnaaz’s fans? If I say something, even that will become news. The issue is that our fans keep fighting among themselves, while we have no role to play in it. Hamara koi lena dena hi nahi hai.”\\n\\nHe adds, “Shehnaz and I didn’t have any problem as such during ‘Bigg Boss’. She used to like me before she moved on to Sidharth Shukla. Achha hai, aap Shukla ke saath hi rahiye. However, what really upset me was when she questioned the virginity of the girls who participated in ‘Mujhse Shaadi Karoge’ (‘MSK’). That wasn’t in good taste. There has been no communication between us since, but there is no grudge either. It’s just that some fans cross the line, which is upsetting.”\\nAsk him about fans crossing the line and Paras replies, “Recently, there were some reports of Shehnaz’s father being accused of rape. Many fans claimed that Mahira and I were circulating the news to defame Shehnaz. It’s funny and annoying at the same time. How can they make such baseless allegations? I had actually thought of filing a complaint at the Crime Branch, but couldn’t as I learnt that a few cops there had tested positive for COVID-19.”\\n\\nWhile Shehnaz has openly confessed that ‘MSK’ was a mistake and her heart wasn’t in it, Paras has no such qualms. Many had called the show a ‘sham’ as he was linked to Mahira. The actor explains, “The creative team approached me for ‘MSK’ during ‘Bigg Boss’ with a view to get me married on screen. They asked me about my equation with Mahira and I told them that I like her. They approached her, too, and she was all set to participate. However, the deal fell through. Aa jaati toh accha hi hota…agar shaadi nahi toh kuchh na kuchh toh ho hi jaata.”\\n\\n\\nSo, where does their equation stand today? Will they continue to stick to ‘just friends’ stance? He answers, “We met a couple of times during the lockdown. Acchi feeling aati hai Mahira se mil kar and we share a beautiful bond. I don’t want to go down the regular route of proposing to her. I want everything to happen organically. Naturally feelings generate ho and automatically relationship shuru ho jaaye. She is a very good friend as of now. Mahira and I like each other a lot, but abhi relationship tak nahi pahunche hai. Had she participated in ‘MSK’, things would have progressed faster.”\\n\\n\\nAnd what about his mother, who mentioned on ‘Bigg Boss’ that she will have a final say on the girl he chooses to spend his life with? ‘Meri mom ko Mahira bahut pasand hai,” he replies with a smile. Well, in that case, what about Aanchal Khurana, who he chose as the winner on ‘MSK’? “She is a good girl, but there can’t be anything beyond that. We are buddies,” he asserts.\\n\\n\\nOn the professional front, while everything has come to a halt owing to the pandemic, Paras has no complaints about the fact that he has been unable to cash in on the golden period post ‘Bigg Boss’. He says, “Of course, I have missed out on events and projects, which I would have been busy with had the pandemic not hit us. However, I am taking this forced break positively. ‘Bigg Boss’ jaise show ke baad dimaag ko rest ki zaroorat padti hai. Things are often blown out of proportion aur kahin na kahin mental pressure toh banta hi hai. Of course, one is bored of the lockdown now. I had entered ‘Bigg Boss’ in September 2019 aur tab se lockdown hi chal raha hai mera. But it’s also a good thing ki rest mil raha hai aur khud ke liye time mil raha hai. Baahar nikalke 100 log bhi pehchaante hain toh guroor aane lagta hai. Lockdown has kept me grounded.”\\n\\n\\nHaving said that, Paras is keeping himself busy. He has joined hands with an app that makes videos featuring celebs. He explains, “It’s an app where fans request for a video, like a birthday wish, and pay for it. Why did I sign up for it, you ask? Well, I will spend a part of the money that I make from it on the needy. I am grateful to Rupesh Sonar, who got me this project.”',\n",

She has gone minimalist and has pledged that she would consume only one meal a day to help the needy.\\n\\nShe says, “It’s all about taking the minimalist approach. As public figures, we can inspire others to follow the same. I am doing it because I believe that it can go a long way in helping the current situation. The virus is here to stay for some more time and soon, we might face a shortage of grains and grocery. There are millions who are sleeping hungry. So, if we eat a little less and pledge to support the ones in need, no one will go hungry. We have to work towards this as a nation, as no one should be left without food.”\\n\\n\\nChahatt is also doing other work to help the less fortunate. She adds, “I am doing my bit of social work, which I don’t want to talk about because I strongly believe in not speaking about the good deeds you do. However, I want to tell people, who are donating stuff to the needy, to add vitamin C and homoeopathy medicine along with the essentials, as they help build immunity. Also, do not forget that all lives are important, not just humans.”',\n",

The city fills me with some kind of energy and unleashes my creative side. If everything goes well, I will have a chance to visit the city again for my new project which will be shot in Lucknow,” he says.\\n\\nThe Bandit Queen actor, who hails from the interiors of Madhya Pradesh, has been making most of the lockdown time by writing and working on his fitness to look better. “Though this pandemic and lockdown has proven bad for everyone, it has also given me the opportunity to do things that had been on my to-do list for a long time. I have been writing a play for a couple of years now, but due to paucity of time, I was not able to do it. This time, I am about to wrap it up, and not only this, I have also started writing a book. I am spending 6-7 hours daily on writing, which makes me feel contented.” The Sarfarosh actor has also been working on his fitness, “The other positive aspect of this lockdown is that I have finally managed to work on my fitness and I am dedicating a couple of hours daily so that I look leaner and fit on screen,” he shares.\\n\\nNamdeo, who was shooting for three films Radhe, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, and The Battle Of Bhima Koregaon before the lockdown feels that post lockdown no active work will take place for months. “For at least three months post lockdown no active work will take place, only planning and scenes involving fewer people will be shot and that too with proper guidelines and precautions.” Ask the actor whether the film industry will be able to recover the losses due to this pandemic and he replies, “It may eventually cope up with this gloomy situation but I don’t think it will be able to recover the loss completely. Even after three months post lockdown, a film is released, the audience will not be there as it used to be because of the fear and that fear will be there for long. So, I think for around a year or so, that loss will always be there. Now, it’s not about recovery but it's about compensating the loss and let us see how things turn up.”\",\n",

This time, he would ensure the terms are clearly spelled out,\" said an AAP leader, requesting anonymity.\\nThe sources in AAP told TOI on Wednesday that poll strategist Prashant Kishore is likely to mediate for Sidhu\\'s entry into AAP. Punjab Congress is already consulting its MLAs and other leaders on their opinion about hiring Kishore\\'s services as poll strategist for the 2022 assembly election\\nWhen contacted, Leader of Opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema said, \"It is not about Navjot Sidhu alone, any leader who wants to stand up against the two traditional parties of Congress and SAD, which follow the same policies when in the saddle, is welcome in AAP. But talks with Sidhu to join AAP are not in my knowledge at this stage,\" he said.\\nAt the same time, many in the AAP feel that with a little less than two years still remaining for the next elections in Punjab, it will be a bit early for Sidhu to make a switch.\\nEarlier, there was talk of Sidhu joining AAP in February and party\\'s state president Bhagwant Mann had said that there was no official communication with the former Congress minister.\\nSome AAP leaders in Punjab have publicly said that Sidhu would be an asset for the party, but others are not sure about his possible role as the existing leadership has failed to put up a united front in the past.\\nTo complicate the matter, sources in the ruling Congress party are of view that Sidhu could again be inducted into Punjab cabinet on instructions of party high command to ensure a truce between him and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh ahead of the 2022 assembly elections.\\nThe rift between the CM and his cabinet minister became public during the campaign for the Lok Sabha elections in May 2019 and in June that year Sidhu was divested of his local government, tourism and cultural affairs portfolios and given the charge of power and new and renewable energy. Sidhu never took over the new ministry and withdrew from public only to return with the opening of one-way communication through his YouTube channel Jittega Punjab in March 2020.\\nA senior Congress leader, who wished to remain anonymous, said the ruling party was aware of Sidhu\\'s ‘excursions\\' and there was a group within the Punjab Congress, which wanted him to be re-inducted as minister with a portfolio of his choice.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Formalising its plan to unlock the growth potential of farm incomes by allowing unrestricted sale of produce, the Centre on Wednesday approved three major legislative reforms through ordinances intended to create “one India, one agriculture market” while also attracting private investments in a sector hamstrung by varying regulations.\\nThe three legislative reforms, which have failed to see light of the day despite several attempts in the past, include laws on promoting barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade in agriculture produce, empowering farmers to engage with processors, aggregators, wholesalers, large retailers and exporters through advance contracts on pre-agreed prices and an amendment to the Essential Commodities Act (ESA) which removes cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from list of essential commodities.\\nThe amendment in the ESA will give freedom to hold, move, distribute and supply such farm commodities and attract private sector and foreign direct investment into agriculture sector.\\n“Long-pending agrarian reforms will enable transformation of the (agriculture) sector,” said Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a series of tweets on the cabinet’s decisions.\\n\\nThe decisions were announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month as part of the government’s stimulus to the farm sector. Since Parliament is not in session, the government in order to provide quick relief to farmers during the Covid-19 situation preferred the ordinance route.\\nAsked how the Centre can legislate as agriculture is a \"state\" subject, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was very much in the domain of the central government as it dealt with inter-state trade of agriculture produce which was covered under the \"Central\" list.\\nCurrently, farmers face several obstacles in marketing their produce as there are restrictions on farmers selling agri-produce outside notified market yards which are governed by the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) legislations of respective states. Under these legislations, farmers can sell their produce only to registered licencees and agents of state governments, who often play the role of informal money lenders.\\nThe ordinance aims to create an ecosystem where farmers and traders enjoy freedom of choice of sale and purchase of agri-produce and open additional trading opportunities outside the APMC market yards to help farmers get remunerative prices due to enlarged competition.\\nThough many states during the lockdown period allowed certain freedom to farmers to maintain supply chain of fruits, vegetables and other farm produce, the central law will provide a a permanent mechanism where farmers can sell directly to individuals, cooperatives or farmer producer organisations (FPOs). The government will bring new legislations in Parliament during its monsoon session to replace the ordinances, approved on Wednesday.\\nThe ordinance on contract farming - Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020 - looks to transfer the risk of market unpredictability to the sponsor and also enable the farmer to access modern technology and better inputs. Since the farmers would now be able to enter into contract with traders and private players on pre-agreed prices, it will ensure guaranteed returns even if their prices crash in the market.\\nThe Centre under Modi’s first term had tried to bring those reforms through model Acts and asked the states to amend their respective APMC Acts. But, most of the states did not come on board. Agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal said the issue was discussed with states through video conference on May 21 and none had any objection.\\nHe said the states would continue with their respective APMC Acts and regulated mandis, but new arrangements under the central law would now simultaneously be available to farmers as additional platforms with adequate safeguards.\\nAs far as amendments to the ESA is concerned, Tomar insisted that there won’t be any compromise with the consumers’ interests. “It has been done in such a way that interest of both farmers and consumers will be protected,” said the agriculture minister.\\nThe amendment has provisions to regulate agricultural items in situations such as war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamity.\\nHowever, the installed capacity of a value chain participant and export demand of exporters will remain exempted from such stock limit imposition so as to ensure that investments in agriculture are not discouraged. Such move will also prevent wastage of agri-produce that happens due to lack of storage facilities in the country.',\n",
       " 'With the lockdown to continue albeit with several relaxations, the fate of the film industry is still uncertain. Cinema halls’ opening any time soon is not on the anvil, which is a cause for concern.\\n\\nIn a chat with us about this, Shabana Azmi said, “Well, I think that is inevitable in this situation. This is something that we have to do, but it’s at a great cost to the film industry. I hope that this isn’t going to last for a long time because that will be very difficult for films, which are ready for release.”\\n\\n\\nWith some films already taking the digital route, the entertainment industry is feeling the pinch. “The digital platform is flourishing and you can see that OTT platforms are doing well, but films are waiting to be seen in the theatres. However, I don’t see people rushing to theatres any time soon. So, even if they decide to exhibit films on TV, it is going to be a big let down in terms of commerce.”\\n\\nAzmi says that at a time like this, just like other industries, the Hindi film industry, too, needs support. “What I find interesting is that the industry is talking about how it is suffering and how it needs support from the government. I agree with that. But for some strange reason, the film industry is always looked upon as ‘these are rich people, they don’t need any kind of support’. Whereas the fact is that we definitely need support because we are a very large industry and at the moment, everybody is suffering – from the biggest producers to the spot boys and daily wage earners. A lot of attempts have been made by people within the film industry to provide relief and I applaud these efforts. However, ultimately, in terms of policy, something has to be done soon,” she signs off.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Google pulled out the ‘Remove China Apps’ (RCA) application from its Play Store on Tuesday.\\nThe software, which claimed to remove apps developed in China from a user’s phone, had gone viral amid a nerve-jangling border stand-off between India and China.\\nAccording to analytics firm Sensor Tower, which tracks the number of downloads of popular applications, RCA was downloaded over 4.7 million times between May 27 and June 1. It’s removal created a furore on Wednesday.\\nJaipur-based firm OneTouch AppLabs (OTA), who had developed RCA, tweeted, “Dear Friends, Google has suspended our #RemoveChinaApps from google play store. Thank you all for your support in past two weeks.”\\nGoogle said the application was removed because it violated the “Privacy, Security and Deception” policies which prohibit any app on the Play Store from “misusing any network, device, or personal data”.']"
